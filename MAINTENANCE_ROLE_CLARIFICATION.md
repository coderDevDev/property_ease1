# Maintenance System - Role Clarification & Changes

## 📋 Overview

This document explains the role-based access control for the maintenance system and the changes made to align with the proper business logic.

---

## ✅ Changes Made (October 17, 2025)

### **Business Logic Clarification**

**Previous Implementation:**
- ❌ Both tenants AND owners could create maintenance requests
- ❌ Owners had a "New Request" button to create requests

**Current Implementation (Corrected):**
- ✅ **Only TENANTS can create maintenance requests**
- ✅ **Owners can only VIEW and MANAGE requests submitted by tenants**

### **Why This Change?**

In a typical property management system:
- **Tenants** report issues and problems they encounter in their units
- **Owners** receive, review, assign, and manage those requests
- This creates a clear workflow: Tenant Reports → Owner Manages → Issue Resolved

---

## 🔄 Maintenance Request Workflow

### **Complete Flow:**

```
1. TENANT SUBMITS REQUEST
   ├─ Tenant notices an issue (e.g., leaky faucet)
   ├─ Goes to /tenant/dashboard/maintenance/new
   ├─ Fills out form with details
   ├─ Uploads photos of the issue
   ├─ Submits request
   └─ Status: PENDING
           ↓
2. OWNER RECEIVES NOTIFICATION
   ├─ Owner gets notification of new request
   ├─ Views request in /owner/dashboard/maintenance
   ├─ Reviews photos and description
   └─ Assesses priority and urgency
           ↓
3. OWNER ASSIGNS PERSONNEL
   ├─ Owner assigns maintenance person/contractor
   ├─ Sets scheduled date and time
   ├─ Adds estimated cost (optional)
   ├─ Updates status to IN PROGRESS
   └─ Tenant receives notification of assignment
           ↓
4. MAINTENANCE PERFORMED
   ├─ Assigned person performs the work
   ├─ Issue is fixed
   └─ Reports back to owner
           ↓
5. OWNER MARKS COMPLETED
   ├─ Owner updates status to COMPLETED
   ├─ Adds completion notes
   ├─ Records actual cost
   ├─ Tenant receives completion notification
   └─ Request archived in history
```

## 🎨 UI Changes

### **Owner Maintenance Page**

**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="flex justify-between">
  <h1>Maintenance Management</h1>
  <Button onClick={() => router.push('/owner/dashboard/maintenance/new')}>
    New Request
  </Button>
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
  <h1>Maintenance Management</h1>
  <p>Manage maintenance requests submitted by tenants</p>
  <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-3">
    <p className="text-sm text-blue-700">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Maintenance requests are submitted by tenants. 
      You can view, assign, and update the status of requests here.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 🔐 Security Implications

### **RLS (Row Level Security) Policies**

**For Tenants:**
```sql
-- Tenants can only create their own requests
CREATE POLICY "Tenants can create maintenance requests"
ON maintenance_requests FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
USING (tenant_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM tenants WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
));

-- Tenants can only view their own requests
CREATE POLICY "Tenants can view own requests"
ON maintenance_requests FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (tenant_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM tenants WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
));
```

**For Owners:**
```sql
-- Owners can view requests from their properties
CREATE POLICY "Owners can view property requests"
ON maintenance_requests FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (property_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM properties WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
));

-- Owners can update status of their property requests
CREATE POLICY "Owners can update property requests"
ON maintenance_requests FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (property_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM properties WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
));

-- Owners CANNOT create maintenance requests (removed)
-- No INSERT policy for owners
```

## 📊 Benefits of This Approach

### **1. Clear Accountability**
- Each request has a clear originator (tenant)
- Tenants are accountable for the accuracy of their reports
- Owners can reference tenant submissions in communications

### **2. Audit Trail**

- Complete history of who reported what and when
- Better for dispute resolution and insurance claims

### **3. Better Communication**
- Tenants feel empowered to report issues
- Direct line of communication about problems
- Owners respond rather than assume issues

### **4. Simpler Workflow**
- One-way flow: Tenant → Owner → Resolution
- No confusion about who created what
- Easier to track and manage

### **5. Compliance**
- Many jurisdictions require tenant-initiated maintenance reporting
- Creates legal documentation of issues reported
- Protects both parties with documented communication
