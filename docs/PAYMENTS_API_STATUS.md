# ✅ PaymentsAPI - Current Status

## 🎯 **File Status: CLEAN & WORKING**

The `lib/api/payments.ts` file has been reverted and is now properly structured.

---

## 🔧 **What's Different from Before:**

### **Removed (Were Causing Corruption):**
- ❌ `generateLeasePayments()` - Moved to separate file
- ❌ `previewLeasePayments()` - Moved to separate file

### **Why Removed:**
The payment generation methods are now in:
```
lib/api/paymentGeneration.ts
```

This keeps the code clean and modular!

---

## 💡 **How to Use Payment Generation:**

Instead of using `PaymentsAPI.generateLeasePayments()`, use:

```typescript
import { PaymentGenerationAPI } from '@/lib/api/paymentGeneration';

// Generate payments
const result = await PaymentGenerationAPI.generateLeasePayments(
  {
    tenant_id: 'xxx',
    property_id: 'xxx',
    monthly_rent: 5000,
    lease_start: '2025-08-01',
    lease_end: '2025-10-31',
    payment_due_day: 5
  },
  owner_user_id
);
```

---

## ✅ **Everything That Works:**

### **1. Regular Payment Operations**
```typescript
import { PaymentsAPI } from '@/lib/api/payments';

// Get tenant's payments
const payments = await PaymentsAPI.getTenantPayments(userId);

// Create payment with Xendit
const result = await PaymentsAPI.createPaymentWithXendit({
  tenant_id: 'xxx',
  property_id: 'xxx',
  amount: 5000,
  due_date: '2025-08-05',
  payment_type: 'rent'
});
```

### **2. Payment Generation (Separate File)**
```typescript
import { PaymentGenerationAPI } from '@/lib/api/paymentGeneration';

// Auto-generate lease payments
const result = await PaymentGenerationAPI.generateLeasePayments(...);
```

### **3. Refund Operations**
```typescript
// Request refund
await PaymentsAPI.requestRefund(paymentId, amount, reason);

// Check if can refund
const { canRefund } = await PaymentsAPI.canRequestRefund(paymentId);
```
