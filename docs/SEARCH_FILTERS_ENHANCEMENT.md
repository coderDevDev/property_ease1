# Search & Filters Enhancement

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Page**: `/tenant/dashboard/payments`  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## 🔴 Issue

Search and filters were only working in **List View**, but not in:
- ❌ Calendar View
- ❌ Timeline View
- ❌ Properties View

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changed: Apply Filters to All Views

**File**: `app/tenant/dashboard/payments/page.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
// Filters only applied to list view
{viewMode === 'calendar' && (
  <PaymentCalendar payments={payments} />  // ❌ Unfiltered
)}

{viewMode === 'timeline' && (
  <PaymentTimeline payments={payments} />  // ❌ Unfiltered
)}

{viewMode === 'properties' && (
  <PropertyPaymentSummary payments={payments} />  // ❌ Unfiltered
)}
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Filters applied to all views
{viewMode === 'calendar' && (
  <PaymentCalendar payments={filteredPayments} />  // ✅ Filtered
)}

{viewMode === 'timeline' && (
  <PaymentTimeline payments={filteredPayments} />  // ✅ Filtered
)}

{viewMode === 'properties' && (
  <PropertyPaymentSummary payments={filteredPayments} />  // ✅ Filtered
)}
```

### Added: advance_rent to Filter Options

**Before**:
```typescript
<option value="rent">Rent</option>
<option value="deposit">Deposit</option>
<option value="security_deposit">Security</option>
```

**After**:
```typescript
<option value="rent">Rent</option>
<option value="advance_rent">Advance Rent</option>  // ✅ Added
<option value="deposit">Deposit (Legacy)</option>  // ✅ Clarified
<option value="security_deposit">Security Deposit</option>
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Search Filter:
Searches across:
- ✅ Payment type (rent, utility, etc.)
- ✅ Property name
- ✅ Reference number

**Example**: Type "electricity" → Shows only utility bills with electricity

---

### Status Filter:
- **All Status** - Shows everything
- **Paid** - Only paid payments
- **Pending** - Only pending payments
- **Failed** - Only failed payments

---

### Type Filter:
- **All Types** - Shows all payment types
- **Rent** - Monthly rent payments
- **Advance Rent** - Upfront advance rent (RA 9653)
- **Deposit (Legacy)** - Old advance rent records
- **Security Deposit** - Refundable security deposit
- **Utility** - Utility bills (water, electricity, etc.)
- **Penalty** - Late fees and penalties

## 📊 Filter Logic

```typescript
const filteredPayments = payments.filter(payment => {
  // Search filter
  const matchesSearch =
    payment.payment_type.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
    payment.property.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
    payment.reference_number?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());

  // Status filter
  const matchesStatus =
    filterStatus === 'all' || payment.payment_status === filterStatus;
  
  // Type filter
  const matchesType =
    filterType === 'all' || payment.payment_type === filterType;

  // Must match all filters
  return matchesSearch && matchesStatus && matchesType;
});
```
