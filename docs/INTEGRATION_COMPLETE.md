## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Database Migration Required:
**MUST run before testing**:
```sql
-- File: supabase/migrations/021_lease_renewals.sql
-- Creates lease_renewals table with RLS policies
```

### TypeScript Errors:
Lint errors about missing modules will resolve after:
- Files are saved
- TypeScript recompiles
- IDE restarts (if needed)

These are normal during development and don't affect functionality.
