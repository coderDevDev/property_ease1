## Quick Start Guide

> **Date**: October 25, 2025  
> **Feature**: Security Deposits Management  
> **Status**: Ready to Test

---

## ‚úÖ **PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST**

Before testing, ensure:
- [x] Migration `012_security_deposits.sql` has been run
- [x] All files created (8 new files)
- [x] Dev server is running
- [ ] Test users exist (tenant & owner)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è **DATABASE SETUP**

### **Step 1: Verify Migration**

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('deposit_balances', 'move_out_inspections', 'deposit_deductions');

-- Should return 3 rows
```

### **Step 2: Check RLS Policies**

```sql
-- Check policies exist
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('deposit_balances', 'move_out_inspections', 'deposit_deductions');

-- Should return multiple policies
```

### **Step 3: Create Test Data** (Optional)

```sql
-- Create a test deposit balance
INSERT INTO deposit_balances (
  tenant_id,
  property_id,
  deposit_amount,
  refundable_amount,
  status
) VALUES (
  'YOUR_TENANT_ID',
  'YOUR_PROPERTY_ID',
  10000,
  10000,
  'held'
);

-- Verify
SELECT * FROM deposit_balances;
```

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue: Deposit Card Not Showing**

**Possible Causes**:
1. No deposit exists in database
2. RLS policy blocking access
3. Tenant ID mismatch

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if deposit exists for tenant
SELECT * FROM deposit_balances 
WHERE tenant_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM tenants WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID'
);

-- Check RLS policy
SET ROLE authenticated;
SELECT * FROM deposit_balances;
```

---

### **Issue: "Cannot find module" Errors**

**Cause**: TypeScript can't resolve imports

**Solution**:
1. Restart TypeScript server in VS Code
2. Run `npm install` (if needed)
3. Check file paths are correct
4. Restart dev server

---

### **Issue: Inspection Not Saving**

**Possible Causes**:
1. User not authenticated
2. RLS policy blocking insert
3. Missing required fields

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Supabase logs
- Verify user has owner role
- Check all required fields filled

---

### **Issue: Triggers Not Working**

**Symptom**: Deductions added but totals not updating

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check triggers exist
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE event_object_table IN ('deposit_deductions', 'move_out_inspections');

-- Manually trigger update
UPDATE move_out_inspections 
SET updated_at = NOW() 
WHERE id = 'INSPECTION_ID';
```

---

## üìä **TEST DATA GENERATOR**

Use this to create test data:

```sql
-- Create test deposit
INSERT INTO deposit_balances (
  tenant_id,
  property_id,
  deposit_amount,
  deductions,
  refundable_amount,
  status
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM tenants LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM properties LIMIT 1),
  15000,
  0,
  15000,
  'held'
) RETURNING *;

-- Create test inspection
INSERT INTO move_out_inspections (
  tenant_id,
  property_id,
  inspector_id,
  inspection_date,
  checklist,
  total_deductions,
  refundable_amount,
  status
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM tenants LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM properties LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE role = 'owner' LIMIT 1),
  NOW(),
  '{"walls": "good", "flooring": "fair", "appliances": "good"}'::jsonb,
  0,
  15000,
  'pending'
) RETURNING *;

-- Create test deduction
INSERT INTO deposit_deductions (
  inspection_id,
  item_description,
  cost,
  category,
  notes
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM move_out_inspections ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1),
  'Wall damage - hole in bedroom',
  2500,
  'Damage',
  'Repair required before new tenant moves in'
) RETURNING *;
```
