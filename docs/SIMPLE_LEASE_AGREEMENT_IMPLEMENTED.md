### **Priority 1: Accept Terms Button**
Add functionality to record when tenant accepts lease:

```typescript
// In lease page
const [termsAccepted, setTermsAccepted] = useState(false);

const handleAcceptTerms = async () => {
  const result = await TenantAPI.acceptLeaseTerms(lease.id);
  if (result.success) {
    setTermsAccepted(true);
    toast.success('Lease terms accepted');
  }
};

// Show button if not accepted
{!termsAccepted && (
  <Button onClick={handleAcceptTerms}>
    ✓ Accept Lease Terms
  </Button>
)}
```

### **Priority 2: PDF Generation**
Generate downloadable PDF:

```bash
npm install @react-pdf/renderer

# Create PDF template
# Generate on lease creation
# Store in Supabase Storage
```

### **Priority 3: E-Signature**
Add digital signature:

```bash
npm install react-signature-canvas

# Capture tenant signature
# Store signature image
# Add to PDF
```

### **Priority 4: Email Notifications**
Send lease documents via email:

```typescript
// On approval, send email
await sendEmail({
  to: tenant.email,
  subject: 'Your Lease Agreement',
  attachments: [leasePDF],
  template: 'lease-approval'
});
```
