# Lease Agreement Download Fix

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Issue**: Incorrect lease data in downloaded PDF  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Tenant Side - Incorrect Lease Data**

**Problem:**
- Lease duration hardcoded to 12 months
- Lease end date calculated incorrectly
- Missing owner information
- Missing property address
- Security deposit not using actual value from tenant record

**Root Cause:**
The tenant application page was using data from the `rental_applications` table, which doesn't have the actual lease information. When an application is approved, a `tenant` record is created with the correct lease dates, but the download function wasn't fetching this data.

---

### 2. ❌ **Owner Side - No Download Lease Button**

**Problem:**
- Owners couldn't download lease agreements from their applications page
- Had to navigate to tenants page to download

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: Tenant Lease Download

**File**: `app/tenant/dashboard/applications/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Fetch Actual Tenant Record**
   ```typescript
   const { data: tenant, error } = await supabase
     .from('tenants')
     .select(`
       *,
       property:properties(
         name, address, city, type, amenities,
         owner:users!properties_owner_id_fkey(
           first_name, last_name, email, phone
         )
       )
     `)
     .eq('user_id', authState.user?.id)
     .eq('property_id', application.property_id)
     .single();
   ```

2. **Calculate Correct Lease Duration**
   ```typescript
   const leaseStart = new Date(tenant.lease_start);
   const leaseEnd = new Date(tenant.lease_end);
   const monthsDiff =
     (leaseEnd.getFullYear() - leaseStart.getFullYear()) * 12 +
     (leaseEnd.getMonth() - leaseStart.getMonth());
   ```

3. **Use Actual Data from Tenant Record**
   ```typescript
   const leaseData = {
     leaseStart: tenant.lease_start,        // ✅ From tenant record
     leaseEnd: tenant.lease_end,            // ✅ From tenant record
     leaseDuration: monthsDiff,             // ✅ Calculated correctly
     monthlyRent: parseFloat(tenant.monthly_rent),
     securityDeposit: parseFloat(tenant.security_deposit), // ✅ Actual value
     ownerName: `${owner.first_name} ${owner.last_name}`,  // ✅ Real owner
     propertyAddress: property.address,     // ✅ Real address
     // ... etc
   };
   ```

### ✅ Fix 2: Owner Lease Download

**File**: `app/owner/dashboard/applications/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

1. **Added Import**
   ```typescript
   import { generateLeaseAgreementPDF } from '@/lib/pdf/leaseAgreementPDF';
   ```

2. **Added Download Handler**
   ```typescript
   const handleDownloadLease = async (application: Application) => {
     // Fetch tenant record with complete data
     const { data: tenant, error } = await supabase
       .from('tenants')
       .select(`
         *,
         user:users!tenants_user_id_fkey(...),
         property:properties(...)
       `)
       .eq('user_id', application.user_id)
       .eq('property_id', application.property_id)
       .single();
     
     // Generate PDF with correct data
     generateLeaseAgreementPDF(leaseData);
   };
   ```

3. **Added Download Button**
   ```tsx
   {selectedApplication.status === 'approved' && (
     <div className="pt-4">
       <Button
         className="w-full bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600"
         onClick={() => handleDownloadLease(selectedApplication)}>
         <Download className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
         Download Lease Agreement
       </Button>
     </div>
   )}
   ```
