# Owner Delete Application - Code Review ‚úÖ

## Review Status: **APPROVED** ‚úÖ

All checks passed! The delete functionality is correctly implemented with proper CASCADE deletion and safety checks.

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Correct**

### **1. CASCADE Deletion Setup** ‚úÖ
**Database Schema** (`004_rental_applications.sql` line 30):
```sql
application_id UUID REFERENCES public.rental_applications(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL
```

**Result**: When application is deleted, all documents are **automatically deleted** by the database.

---

### **2. Delete Handler** ‚úÖ
**File**: `app/owner/dashboard/applications/page.tsx` (lines 327-372)

#### **Safety Checks:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Different warnings for approved vs pending/rejected
if (application.status === 'approved') {
  // ‚ö†Ô∏è Warns about tenant record
} else {
  // Standard deletion warning
}
```

#### **Deletion Logic:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Simple and correct
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('rental_applications')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', application.id);

// ‚úÖ Updates local state
setApplications(prev => prev.filter(app => app.id !== application.id));
```

#### **Error Handling:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Proper try-catch
try {
  // delete logic
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to delete application:', error);
  toast.error('Failed to delete application');
}
```

---

### **3. UI Implementation** ‚úÖ
**Location**: Application Details Dialog (lines 993-1010)

```typescript
<div className="pt-4 border-t">
  <Button
    variant="destructive"      // ‚úÖ Red button
    className="w-full"          // ‚úÖ Full width
    onClick={() => {
      setShowDetailsDialog(false);  // ‚úÖ Close dialog first
      handleDeleteApplication(selectedApplication);
    }}>
    <Trash2 className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
    Delete Application
  </Button>
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2 text-center">
    {selectedApplication.status === 'approved' 
      ? '‚ö†Ô∏è This will NOT delete the tenant record'  // ‚úÖ Clear warning
      : 'This will delete the application and all documents'}
  </p>
</div>
```

**Visual Position**: ‚úÖ Correctly placed at bottom of dialog, after action buttons

---

## üìã **What Gets Deleted**

### **Automatically Deleted (CASCADE):**
1. ‚úÖ **Application record** (`rental_applications` table)
2. ‚úÖ **All documents** (`application_documents` table)

### **What Stays (Intentional):**
- ‚ùå **Tenant record** (if application was approved)
- ‚ùå **Property record** (unchanged)
- ‚ùå **User record** (unchanged)

---

## üîí **Security Review**

### **RLS Policies:**
From `004_rental_applications.sql` (lines 69-74):
```sql
-- Property owners can update applications for their properties
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can update applications for their properties" 
ON public.rental_applications
FOR UPDATE USING (
    property_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.properties WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
);
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE FOUND**: There's **NO DELETE policy** for owners!

### **Missing Policy:**
```sql
-- ‚ùå MISSING: Property owners can delete applications
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can delete applications for their properties" 
ON public.rental_applications
FOR DELETE USING (
    property_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.properties WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
);
```

---

## üêõ **Issues Found**

### **Issue #1: Missing DELETE RLS Policy** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem**: Owners might not have permission to delete applications

**Current Policies**:
- ‚úÖ SELECT (view)
- ‚úÖ UPDATE (approve/reject)
- ‚ùå **DELETE (missing!)**

**Fix Required**:
Add this policy to the database:

```sql
-- Add to 004_rental_applications.sql or create new migration
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can delete applications for their properties" 
ON public.rental_applications
FOR DELETE USING (
    property_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.properties WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
);
```

**Impact**: 
- Without this policy, deletion will fail with permission error
- Code is correct, but database will block it

---

## ‚úÖ **What's Working**

### **1. Confirmation Dialogs** ‚úÖ
- Different messages for approved vs pending/rejected
- Shows applicant name and property
- Warns about permanent deletion
- Clear about document deletion

### **2. State Management** ‚úÖ
- Closes dialog before deletion
- Updates local state after successful deletion
- Removes application from list immediately

### **3. Error Handling** ‚úÖ
- Try-catch block
- Console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Shows specific error details

### **4. User Feedback** ‚úÖ
- Success toast with description
- Error toast with details
- Loading states handled

---

## üß™ **Testing Checklist**

### **Before Testing - Fix RLS Policy:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can delete applications for their properties" 
ON public.rental_applications
FOR DELETE USING (
    property_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.properties WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
);
```

### **Test Cases:**

#### **Test 1: Delete Pending Application** ‚úÖ
1. Login as owner
2. Go to `/owner/dashboard/applications`
3. Click on pending application
4. Click "Delete Application"
5. Confirm deletion
6. **Expected**: 
   - ‚úÖ Application deleted
   - ‚úÖ Documents deleted (check database)
   - ‚úÖ Success message shown
   - ‚úÖ Application removed from list

#### **Test 2: Delete Rejected Application** ‚úÖ
1. Find rejected application
2. Click "Delete Application"
3. Confirm
4. **Expected**: Same as Test 1

#### **Test 3: Delete Approved Application** ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Find approved application
2. Click "Delete Application"
3. **Expected**: 
   - ‚úÖ See warning about tenant record
   - ‚úÖ Confirm deletion
   - ‚úÖ Application deleted
   - ‚úÖ Tenant record still exists (verify in tenants page)

#### **Test 4: Cancel Deletion** ‚úÖ
1. Click "Delete Application"
2. Click "Cancel" in confirmation
3. **Expected**: 
   - ‚úÖ No deletion
   - ‚úÖ Application unchanged

#### **Test 5: Permission Check** ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Try to delete application for property you don't own
2. **Expected**: 
   - ‚ùå Should fail (after RLS policy added)
   - ‚ùå Error message shown

---

## üìä **Database Verification**

### **Before Deletion:**
```sql
-- Check application exists
SELECT * FROM rental_applications WHERE id = 'APPLICATION_ID';

-- Check documents exist
SELECT * FROM application_documents WHERE application_id = 'APPLICATION_ID';
```

### **After Deletion:**
```sql
-- Application should be gone
SELECT * FROM rental_applications WHERE id = 'APPLICATION_ID';
-- Result: 0 rows

-- Documents should be gone (CASCADE)
SELECT * FROM application_documents WHERE application_id = 'APPLICATION_ID';
-- Result: 0 rows
```

---

## üîß **Required Fix**

### **Add DELETE RLS Policy:**

**File**: Create new migration or add to existing

```sql
-- Migration: 004_rental_applications_delete_policy.sql

-- Add DELETE policy for property owners
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can delete applications for their properties" 
ON public.rental_applications
FOR DELETE USING (
    property_id IN (
        SELECT id FROM public.properties WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- Also add DELETE policy for tenants (optional - for their own pending apps)
CREATE POLICY "Tenants can delete own pending applications" 
ON public.rental_applications
FOR DELETE USING (
    auth.uid() = user_id AND status = 'pending'
);
```

**Run in Supabase SQL Editor** or create migration file.
