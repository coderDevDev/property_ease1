# Navigation Fix - Deposits Page Access

## Issue
When testing as an owner on `/owner/dashboard`, the deposits page was not accessible because there was no navigation link in the sidebar.

## Root Cause
The `shared-sidebar.tsx` component did not include navigation items for the new payment features:
- Security Deposits
- Utility Bills  
- Advance Payments

Even though the pages existed in the file system, they were not accessible through the UI.

## Solution Applied
Added three new navigation items to the owner's sidebar in the **Financial** section:

### New Navigation Items
1. **Deposits** (`/owner/dashboard/deposits`)
   - Icon: Shield
   - Description: Security deposits

2. **Utility Bills** (`/owner/dashboard/utility-bills`)
   - Icon: Zap
   - Description: Utility management

3. **Advance Payments** (`/owner/dashboard/advance-payments`)
   - Icon: TrendingUp
   - Description: Advance rent tracking

## Files Modified
- `client/components/layout/shared-sidebar.tsx`
  - Added Shield, Zap, TrendingUp icons to imports
  - Added three new sidebar items in the 'financial' section

## How to Test
1. Login as an owner
2. Navigate to `/owner/dashboard`
3. Look at the sidebar under the **Financial** section
4. You should now see:
   - Payments
   - **Deposits** ← NEW
   - **Utility Bills** ← NEW
   - **Advance Payments** ← NEW
5. Click on "Deposits" to navigate to `/owner/dashboard/deposits`

## Expected Result
✅ The deposits page should now be accessible from the sidebar
✅ All three new payment features are now visible in the navigation
✅ The Financial section now has 4 items instead of 1

## Testing Guide Reference
Continue testing from **Test 1.1: Owner Creates Deposit** in the Complete Testing Guide:
- Route: `/owner/dashboard/deposits`
- You can now access this page via the sidebar navigation
