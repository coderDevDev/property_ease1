# Owner Components Organization - PropertyEase

## 🎯 **Complete Restructuring Implemented**

The PropertyEase application has been successfully restructured to provide better organization for owner-related components and features, following the principles outlined in `design.text`.

---

## 📁 **New Folder Structure**

### **Owner-Specific Routes**

```
client/app/owner/
├── layout.tsx                     # Owner-specific layout with sidebar
├── components/
│   └── property-owner-sidebar.tsx # Updated sidebar component
└── dashboard/
    ├── page.tsx                   # Main owner dashboard
    ├── properties/
    │   └── page.tsx              # Property management page
    ├── tenants/
    ├── maintenance/
    ├── payments/
    ├── messages/
    ├── announcements/
    ├── documents/
    ├── analytics/
    ├── transactions/
    ├── notifications/
    ├── settings/
    └── profile/
```

### **Updated General Routes**

```
client/app/dashboard/
├── layout.tsx     # Now admin-only (redirects owners to /owner)
└── page.tsx       # Redirects owners to /owner/dashboard
```

## 🎨 **Design Consistency (Per design.text)**

### **Applied Modern Blue Theme (#1E88E5 Family)**

#### **Primary Colors**

- **Primary Blue**: `#1E88E5` - Buttons, highlights, active states
- **Secondary Blue**: `#1565C0` - Headers, navigation elements
- **Accent Color**: `#42A5F5` - Hover states, secondary actions
- **Background**: Blue gradients with white-gray base
- **Text**: Proper contrast with `#1F2937` for readability

#### **Component Styling**

- ✅ **Rounded corners**: 8-12px radius throughout
- ✅ **Gradient backgrounds**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 via-slate-50 to-blue-100`
- ✅ **Card-based interfaces**: White/semi-transparent cards with blue borders
- ✅ **Smooth animations**: Hover effects, scale transforms, shadow transitions
- ✅ **Modern typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy

## 🔄 **Routing Updates**

### **Owner Authentication Flow**

1. **Login** → Role detection → **Owner Dashboard** (`/owner/dashboard`)
2. **Dashboard Layout** (`/dashboard`) → Redirects owners to `/owner/dashboard`
3. **Main Dashboard Page** (`/dashboard/page.tsx`) → Redirects owners to `/owner/dashboard`

### **Owner Feature Routes**

- **Dashboard**: `/owner/dashboard` (Main overview)
- **Properties**: `/owner/dashboard/properties` (Property management)
- **Tenants**: `/owner/dashboard/tenants` (Tenant management)
- **Maintenance**: `/owner/dashboard/maintenance` (Repair requests)
- **Payments**: `/owner/dashboard/payments` (Payment tracking)
- **Messages**: `/owner/dashboard/messages` (Communication)
- **Announcements**: `/owner/dashboard/announcements` (Property updates)
- **Documents**: `/owner/dashboard/documents` (File management)
- **Analytics**: `/owner/dashboard/analytics` (Property insights)
- **Transactions**: `/owner/dashboard/transactions` (Payment history)
- **Notifications**: `/owner/dashboard/notifications` (System alerts)
- **Settings**: `/owner/dashboard/settings` (Account preferences)
- **Profile**: `/owner/dashboard/profile` (Personal information)
