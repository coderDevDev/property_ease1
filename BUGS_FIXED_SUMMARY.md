# 🐛 Bug Fixes Summary - October 17, 2025

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES (4/8)

### **1. Owner Self-Notifications for Announcements** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Owners were receiving notifications for their own announcements.

**Solution:**
- Modified `AnnouncementsAPI.createAnnouncementNotifications()` to exclude creator
- Added `creatorId` parameter and filter logic
- Creator is now excluded from notification recipients

**Files Changed:**
- `client/lib/api/announcements.ts`

**Testing:**
1. Log in as owner
2. Create a new announcement
3. Check notifications - you should NOT see your own announcement
4. Other users should still receive the notification

---

### **2. Profile Button Navigation** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Profile button was redirecting to dashboard instead of profile page.

**Solution:**
- Added `getProfilePath()` function for role-based routing
- Updated menu item to use correct path:
  - Owners → `/owner/dashboard/profile`
  - Tenants → `/tenant/dashboard/profile`

**Files Changed:**
- `client/components/layout/top-navbar.tsx`

**Testing:**
1. Log in as owner or tenant
2. Click profile picture in top right
3. Click "Profile" menu item
4. Should navigate to your profile page, not dashboard

---

### **3. Payment Schedule Order** ✅ VERIFIED CORRECT
**Problem:** Requested to show latest payments first.

**Finding:**
- Already implemented correctly
- Payments ordered with `.order('created_at', { ascending: false })`
- Latest payments appear first (descending order)

**No Changes Required**

---

### **4. Emergency Contact Column Error** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Error "could not find emergency_contact_name column" when creating tenant.

**Root Cause:**
- Emergency contact fields belong to `users` table, not `tenants` table
- Form was trying to insert these fields into wrong table

**Solution:**
- Removed emergency contact section from tenant creation form
- These fields should be managed in user profile, not tenant record
- Removed from form data: `emergency_contact_name`, `emergency_contact_phone`

**Files Changed:**
- `client/app/owner/dashboard/tenants/new/page.tsx`

**Testing:**
1. Go to `/owner/dashboard/tenants/new`
2. Fill out tenant form
3. Submit - should create successfully without errors
4. Emergency contact info can be managed in user's profile instead
