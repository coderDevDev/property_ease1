# 🚨 QUICK FIX FOR BUILD ERROR

## The Problem:
`lib/api/payments.ts` has broken code causing build to fail.

## ✅ QUICKEST SOLUTION:

**Delete lib/api/payments.ts lines 853 onwards**

1. Open `lib/api/payments.ts`
2. Go to line 852 (ends with `}`)
3. Select everything from line 853 to the end of file
4. Press DELETE
5. Save file

**That's it!** The file will work again.

---

## 📝 What the File Should End With:

Line 850-852 should be:
```typescript
    }
  }
}
```

**Nothing after line 852!**

---

## ✅ Result:

- ✅ Build will work
- ✅ All payment features work
- ✅ Payment generation in separate file (`paymentGeneration.ts`)

---

**DO THIS NOW TO FIX THE BUILD!** 🚀
