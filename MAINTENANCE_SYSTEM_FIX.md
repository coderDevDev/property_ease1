# Maintenance System Fix & Testing Guide

## üîß Issues Fixed

### **Critical Issue: Tenant Maintenance Request Creation Error**

**Error:** `Failed to load tenant data: Error: Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object`

**Root Cause:**
- The tenant maintenance page was using `.single()` in the Supabase query
- This fails when a tenant has multiple active leases across different properties
- The query couldn't handle scenarios where one user is a tenant in multiple properties

**Fix Applied:**
1. Removed `.single()` from the query to handle multiple tenant records
2. Added proper handling for multiple properties per tenant
3. Implemented dynamic tenant ID selection based on property selection
4. Auto-selects property if tenant has only one active lease

### **File Modified:**
`client/app/tenant/dashboard/maintenance/new/page.tsx`

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Property Not Showing in Dropdown**

**Symptoms:**
- Tenant sees empty property dropdown
- "No active lease found" message

**Solutions:**
1. Verify tenant has an active lease in database
2. Check `tenants` table for records with:
   - `user_id` matching current user
   - `status` = 'active'
3. Verify property relationship exists
4. Check Supabase RLS policies

### **Issue 2: Cannot Upload Images**

**Symptoms:**
- Image upload fails
- "Maximum file size" error

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure images are under 5MB each
2. Verify image format (PNG, JPG, GIF supported)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Clear browser cache
5. Try different image or reduce size

### **Issue 3: Maintenance Request Not Appearing**

**Symptoms:**
- Request submitted but not in list
- Success message appears but no data

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Check filter settings (might be filtering out the request)
3. Verify request was created in database
4. Check tenant_id matches correctly
5. Review browser console for API errors

### **Issue 4: "Cannot coerce to single JSON object" Error**

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

This error occurred when tenants had multiple active leases. The fix now properly handles multiple properties per tenant.
