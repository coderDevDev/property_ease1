# Bug Fixes - October 17, 2025

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### **Issue #1: Owner Receiving Self-Notifications for Announcements** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** When an owner creates an announcement, they receive a notification about their own announcement.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `AnnouncementsAPI.createAnnouncement()` to pass `creatorId`
- Updated `createAnnouncementNotifications()` to accept and filter out the creator
- Added logic: `targetUserIds = targetUserIds.filter(userId => userId !== creatorId)`

**Files Changed:**
- `client/lib/api/announcements.ts` (lines 247-352, 499-595)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Owners no longer receive notifications for their own announcements

---

### **Issue #2: Profile Button Redirecting to Dashboard** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Clicking "Profile" in the upper right menu was showing the dashboard instead of the profile page.

**Solution:**
- Added `getProfilePath()` function to route based on user role
- Updated profile menu item to use `getProfilePath()` instead of hardcoded `/dashboard/profile`
- Now correctly routes to:
  - Owners: `/owner/dashboard/profile`
  - Tenants: `/tenant/dashboard/profile`

**Files Changed:**
- `client/components/layout/top-navbar.tsx` (lines 264-266, 651)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Profile button now correctly navigates to profile page

---

### **Issue #3: Payment Schedule Order** ‚úÖ ALREADY CORRECT
**Problem:** Payments should show latest first.

**Finding:** 
- Checked `client/lib/api/payments.ts`
- Payments are already ordered with `.order('created_at', { ascending: false })`
- This means latest payments are already shown first (descending order)

**Status:** ‚úÖ No fix needed - Already working correctly

---

### **Issue #6: Emergency Contact Name Column Error** ‚è≥ NEEDS FIX
**Problem:** Error when creating new tenant - "could not find emergency_contact_name column"
